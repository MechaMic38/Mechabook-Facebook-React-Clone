## How It Works

<p>
  Before you can start using this app, the website will invite you to login thorugh the <strong>Login</strong> page (you need a Gmail account to login).
</p>

<p>
  Once you're in, you'll be able to chat through the <strong>Message Sender</strong>, see all the messages and images sent so far by other people in the <strong>Feed</strong>, and also share images (JPEG / PNG / GIF only).
